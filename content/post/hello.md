We just getting started.

<!--more-->

Honestly we have 2 blog, [this blog was](https://github.com/evilfactorylabs/blog/issues) our primary blog for
writing any _technical_ thing(s), and here is for writing anything that related with evilfactory in
internal. In this blog we will share about what we did, what our mission, what our expenses, etc.
etc. etc.

Mostly written by [@108kb](https://github.com/108kb). Think this blog is as your internal "company"
blog, but we publish it to the public. In this blog we will documenting our journey in how we
accomplish our mission, our _internal_ briefing (like standup), our _internal_ retrospectives, our
growth, and so on and so on. We will publish in several topics, like:

- [culture](/tags/culture/) (this is how we try to "build" a culture)
- [expense](/tags/expense/) (this is how we spend the money)
- [briefing](/tags/briefing/) (this is how we got brief)
- [retrospectives](/tags/retrospectives/) (this is how we learn from what we did)
- [insight](/tags/insight/) (this is how we share insight about us)

We are transparent enough and want to be a good & healthy small community/movement.
