We are small, distributed, agile, and practial. We do care both with user & developer experience. We believes that modern technologies solve modern problem.

Beside making software, we do help people & stakeholders build software on top modern web technologies.

Open Source is our DNA. While we are relying on Open Source software, we are giving back to the community by open source-ing our software, libraries we made, and knowledge we have.
